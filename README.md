# Software Engineering Activities Repository

Welcome to our GitHub repository for the Software Engineering (ISE4133) class at the Cisco Developers' Networking Academy!

## ðŸ“š About This Project
This repository is used by our team to complete class activities, exercises, and collaborative software engineering projects. Each team member has their own branch named after them to work independently while contributing to the overall progress of the team.

## ðŸ”€ Branch Structure
- `main` â€” Central branch containing the combined and final versions of activities.
- `[student_id]` â€” Individual branches for each team member (`abdulloh`, `botagoz`, `nazarbek`, `eldar`, `adinai`) where personal contributions and assignments are developed before merging.

## ðŸ”§ How We Work
1. Each member develops their work in their respective branch.
2. After completing an activity, a pull request is made to merge into `main`.
3. Code is reviewed, discussed, and merged after approval.

## âœ… Goals
- Apply collaborative development practices
- Gain experience with Git workflows
- Document and track progress of class assignments

## ðŸ“Ž Notes
Please check individual branches for ongoing work and in-progress activities.
